# SwitchBot Codex Plugin

Codex plugin for SwitchBot smart-home control through the authoritative
`switchbot` CLI MCP server.

## What it installs

- A Codex skill at `skills/switchbot/SKILL.md`
- An MCP server definition that runs `switchbot mcp serve --tools all`
- An `onInstall` hook that checks the CLI and credentials
- A bootstrap binary: `switchbot-codex-install`

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=18`
- `@switchbot/openapi-cli >=3.7.1`
- Codex with plugin marketplace support

## Install

### Recommended

```bash
npm install -g @cly-org/switchbot-codex-plugin
switchbot-codex-install
```

`switchbot-codex-install` installs or upgrades the CLI if needed, registers the
plugin with Codex, adds it, then verifies credentials. If credentials are
missing it launches `switchbot auth login` directly, so successful setup does
not depend on Codex `plugin_hooks` being enabled.

### Direct Codex install

If you install the plugin from Codex itself, enable plugin hooks for automatic
first-run auth:

```toml
[features]
plugin_hooks = true
```

Without hooks, install still succeeds, but you must run `switchbot auth login`
manually before using the plugin.

## Verify

Run:

```bash
switchbot --version
switchbot doctor
switchbot devices list
```

Then restart Codex and ask:

> List my SwitchBot devices and tell me which ones are currently on.

## If install succeeds but you are not logged in

This usually means the plugin installed, but the browser auth step did not run
or did not complete.

Run:

```bash
switchbot-codex-auth
```

If you prefer the CLI directly:

```bash
switchbot auth login
switchbot doctor
```

Do not paste your token or secret into Codex chat. The login flow stores
credentials in your OS keychain.

## Re-login

Use this when `switchbot doctor` reports auth failures, the token was rotated,
or Codex says credentials exist but are rejected.

```bash
switchbot auth logout
switchbot auth login
switchbot doctor
switchbot devices list
```

After re-login, restart Codex and retry:

> List my SwitchBot devices and tell me which ones are currently on.

## Verify End-To-End

For a full release-style verification, run:

```bash
switchbot --version
switchbot doctor
switchbot devices list
```

Expected result:

- `switchbot --version` is `3.7.1` or newer
- `switchbot doctor` completes without credential failures
- `switchbot devices list` returns your devices
- Codex can answer the device prompt without asking for secrets

## Uninstall

Remove the plugin entry you installed. Common Codex plugin IDs are:

```bash
codex plugin remove switchbot@switchbot-skill
codex plugin remove switchbot@codex-plugin
codex plugin remove switchbot@switchbot-codex-plugin
```

Repo-marketplace installs usually use `switchbot@switchbot-skill`. Package-local
marketplace installs may use one of the other IDs depending on the registered
marketplace name.

If you installed the npm package globally and also want to remove the helper
commands:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @cly-org/switchbot-codex-plugin
```

## Full Uninstall

To remove the plugin, local policy files, and stored login state:

```bash
codex plugin remove switchbot@switchbot-skill
codex plugin remove switchbot@codex-plugin
codex plugin remove switchbot@switchbot-codex-plugin
switchbot auth logout
```

Optional cleanup:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @cly-org/switchbot-codex-plugin
npm uninstall -g @switchbot/openapi-cli
```

Key detail: deleting local files under `~/.switchbot` does not automatically
remove credentials from the OS keychain. Use `switchbot auth logout` when you
want a true logout.
